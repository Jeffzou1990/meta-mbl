# Descriptive Meta-data
SUMMARY = "Python library for mathematics, science, and engineering"
DESCRIPTION = "\
    SciPy (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is open-source software for \
    mathematics, science, and engineering. The SciPy library depends on NumPy, \
    which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy \
    library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and \
    efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and \
    optimization. Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to \
    install, and are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful \
    enough to be depended upon by some of the world’s leading scientists and \
    engineers. If you need to manipulate numbers on a computer and display or \
    publish the results, give SciPy a try! \
