# This recipe builds the ARM Trusted Firmware for RaspberryPi3. 
# - TF-A and OPTEE as 64-bit (aarch64) are built with the aarch64 toolchain
#   because the boot loader of VideoCore4 will boot to 64-bit ARM bootloaders.
#   The TF-A secure monitor changes to 32-bit mode before running U-Boot.
# - The recipe imports mbedtls into the ATF build directory to build libmbedtls.a 
#   and incorporated into the firmware.

# LDFLAGS is configured in bitbake.conf as linker flags to be passed to CC. 
# It sets it to include "-Wl,-O1". The ATF build system inherits LDFLAGS 
# from the environment and passes it directly to LD when building BL1, 
# in conflict with the bitbake view. This then causes an error message
# in the ATF trace (aarch64-linux-gnu-ld.bfd: unrecognized option '-Wl,-O1').  
# This problem is avoided by clearing LDFLAGS.
