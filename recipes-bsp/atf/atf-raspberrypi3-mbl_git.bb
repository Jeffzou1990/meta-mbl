# This recipe builds the ARM Trusted Firmware for RaspberryPi3.
# - TF-A and OPTEE as 64-bit (aarch64) are built with the aarch64 toolchain
#   because the boot loader of VideoCore4 will boot to 64-bit ARM bootloaders.
#   The TF-A secure monitor changes to 32-bit mode before running U-Boot.
# - The recipe imports mbedtls into the ATF build directory to build libmbedtls.a
#   and incorporated into the firmware.
